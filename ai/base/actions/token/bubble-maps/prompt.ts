export const BASE_BUBBLE_MAPS_PROMPT = 
`Analyze and display the bubble map data for a token on the Base Chain.

This will show:
1. The actual distribution of token holders
2. Identification of major holders and their wallet addresses
3. Relationships between significant holders
4. Potential concentration of ownership
5. Analysis of holder behavior and patterns

You can search for a token by its name, ticker, or contract address. The data will help identify ownership patterns, potential risks, and market dynamics.

Note: If bubble map data is not available for the requested token, I will suggest alternative ways to analyze the token's holder distribution.`;
