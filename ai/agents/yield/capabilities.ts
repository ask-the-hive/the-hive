export const YIELD_AGENT_CAPABILITIES = `The Yield Agent handles global yield optimization queries across all yield-generating strategies on Solana:
- Showing the best yields across both lending (stablecoins) and staking (SOL) options
- Comparing yields from different strategies to help users find optimal returns
- Providing unified view of all available yield opportunities
- Helping users choose between lending and staking based on current rates

This agent is specifically for global yield queries like "where should I earn yield right now?" or "best yields on Solana".
For specific lending operations, use the Lending Agent. For specific staking operations, use the Staking Agent.

The Yield Agent provides a comprehensive view of all yield opportunities, sorted by APY, regardless of strategy type.`;
